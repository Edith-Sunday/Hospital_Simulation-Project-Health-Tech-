![medical-records](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b862626-7bb2-46db-a7f1-178e3498763d)

This project simulates a hospital management environment to showcase practical data analytics skills using Python, SQL, and Excel. It includes realistic patient, appointment, billing, and diagnosis data â€” all generated with Python and analyzed to uncover key healthcare insights.


## Project Overview

This project simulates:
- Patient registrations
- Doctor assignments across departments
- Appointments and visit logs
- Diagnoses and prescriptions
- Billing and insurance records

The final deliverables include:
- Cleaned and structured datasets
- SQL database schema + queries
- Visual KPIs and charts
- Excel dashboard with embedded analytics



##  Objectives

- Simulate hospital operations data using Python and Faker
- Clean and transform data using Pandas
- Perform relational analysis using SQL logic
- Generate insights and visualizations using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Build a visually rich Excel dashboard to present findings


##  Tools & Technologies
Faker, Pandas, Matplotlib + Seaborn, SQL (via Pandas), Excel (xlsxwriter)


##  Key Features

- Realistic simulation of hospital appointments and records
- SQL-like queries to analyze:
  - Doctor workloads
  - Revenue per department
  - Diagnosis frequency per doctor
- Visual KPIs including:
  - Appointment status breakdown
  - Insurance usage rates
